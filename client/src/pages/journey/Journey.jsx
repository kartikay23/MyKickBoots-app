          Our entire life when we shop, we are limited by choices that are
                there in a store. We are often on the side where we buy our
                favourite coloured shoes made by someone else but what if we
                designed it? What if we could involve in the making of a shoe we
                want to buy? This little thought sprouted to become what we are
                today. My Kick Boots !!!

          Understanding the trends in the industry and what the users
                think when they buy were our top priorities before we moved
                further in the building. After weeks of fruitful research, we
                stepped into the user's shoes and look at what we plan to do.
                It's a great joy for the users if they are involved in the
                making. We're heading into an era of technology and people
                prefer online shopping to shopping in an outlet.

          Every milestone begins with a single step and before KICKSUP
                sprouted, the team manufactured in small scale with two users a
                month. This experience was crucial to our brand as this is our
                first practical experience. Interacting with the users was the
                best thing ever. The positive reviews and support from people
                motivated us to push our limits further.
